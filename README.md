# EBooks.CBZ.Formatter

A quick tool to help format CBZ files.

I found that CBZ ebooks were very inconsistent in terms of formatting, and often made my Kobo bootloop.

I experimented with a slightly more functional layout than I usually use based on the [Dependency rejection](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/02/02/dependency-rejection/) blog post by Mark Seemann

## Things to investigate improving
[ ] Is it possible to pipe my files in (bash style) instead of having to give the file location and read them in?
